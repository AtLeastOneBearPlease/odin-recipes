    <p>This recipe is the result of me throwing stuff together one night for dinner. I was actually going to make something else and didnâ€™t have all the ingredients.
    Next thing I know, this Quick and Easy Chicken Stir Fry Recipe was born and it was so tasty!  Even better, this skillet recipe is very frugal. The entire dish has a really good flavor with the blend of soy sauce and honey. The sweet and savory chicken is so flavorful when combined with these easy ingredients.</p>
