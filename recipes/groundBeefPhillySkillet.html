    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is pretty much what it sounds like! It's philly style ground beef, no bun, made in a skillet!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>24 oz white mushrooms sliced or chopped (340g)</li>
            <li>2 tsp. salt divided</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp. pepper</li>
            <li>2 bell pepper thinly sliced or diced (200g)</li>
            <li>1 large white or yellow onion diced (200g)</li>
            <li>2 lb. extra lean 96/4 ground beef 448g (the grass-fed grass finished beef tastes better. The square packages)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. Worcester sauce 15g</li>
            <li>4 frozen garlic cubes or minced cloves</li>
            <li>2 cup provolone sharp white cheddar, or mozzarella cheese, grated (82g)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large, heavy skillet to high heat. Spray the pan with a spritz of olive oil and let that heat for a minute. Add the mushrooms along with half of the salt, and the pepper. Cook for three minutes. Add the peppers and diced onions and cook for an additional 5 minutes, stirring often until the veggies are fragrant and tender.</li>
            <li>Push the veggies to one side of the pan and add your ground beef and remaining salt. Using a meat masher or a wooden spoon, break up the meat until itâ€™s browned and cooked through. Add the Worcester sauce and garlic and continue to cook for about two minutes. Add any additional salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and top with grated cheese. Cover until the cheese is melty. Enjoy on toasted buns, on a baked potato, over rice, or your favorite low-carb base like cauliflower rice or spaghetti squash!</li>
        </ol>
